        <p>I have decided to take some time out to pursue a few exciting side projects.
		I hope to become proficient at front-end web development in the next bit of 
		time and to begin the development of an application for virtual reality-my 
		one true love.</p>
		<p>In addition, I will also include some of my various smaller, projects that 
		I'm working on to keep my sanity. These are essentially my hobbies, but I 
		would love to share them and encourage others to pursue theirs, as well.</p>

		<h2>Web Development</h2>
		<p>Here's our first example! I dabbled in my undergraduate career, but
		I have recently started amping up my skills. In the effort of creating 
		responsibly responsive websites, I'm relearning the basics.
		I hope to take commissions in the future.

		<h2>Virtual Reality</h2>
		<p>While VR is one of my passions, I currently do not belong to a research
		laboratory. I hope to create a fun VR experience that anyone can enjoy 
		with Google Carboard. More on this at a later time!</p>
