Personal Website for Haley Alexander Adams

This was a fun little project, and I will maintain this website as an ongoing project to tinker with in my free time. 

In my next major update I will add video demos and source code for my completed portfolio projects. This will take a little time, since most of my design projects involve the use of patient data. In addition, over the summer I hope to add a small technical blog to discuss more in depth how I was able to accomplish certain programming tasks, especially for Unity (game engine). 

Thank you for stopping by. I hope you enjoy my website.
