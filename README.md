Personal Website for Haley Alexander Adams

I'm not a fan of many of the conventional 'mobile-first' web development trends. Therefore, for my personal website I have elected to use pure html and css. This was a fun little project, and I will maintain this website as an ongoing project to tinker with in my free time. 

Thank you for stopping by. I hope you've enjoyed my little readme file.
