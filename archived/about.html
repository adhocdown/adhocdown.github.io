<p> One of the most appealing aspects of computer science is that it brings an unending stream of new and interesting problems.
The umbrella of Extended Reality (XR), in particular, introduces a human component to this discipline. 
At the start of my career, I spent one summer working with <a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~interran/"> Dr. Victoria Interrante </a>  at the University
of Minnesota. There I was introduced to research at the intersections of virtual reality (VR), medicine, and perception. The potential
for VR to unite seemingly disparate disciplines is boundless and speaks to its nascent potential. In Interrante's lab I conducted preliminary
investigations into the realm of neurocognitive assessment via immersive simulation. The assessment was designed to assist diagnosis for patients
with a realm of impairments, such as: dementia, alzheimer's, and traumatic brain injury. 

<p> At my alma mater, Rhodes College, I continued my research pursuits with <a href="https://www.rhodes.edu/bio/sandersb"> Dr. Betsy Williams Sanders.</a>  
For my senior thesis, I conducted an investigation into the effect of interpersonal familiarity on collaboration in virtual reality. 
In other words, I wanted to discover if interacting with another human prior to collaboration in VR would affect performance. 
During my time at Rhodes, I also pioneered a coding camp for middle and high school girls in the Memphis area alongside Dr. Sanders. Designing the curriculum 
for <a href="https://www.rhodes.edu/stories/putting-camp-campus"> Camp Codette </a> is easily one of my proudest achievements. I developed sessions 
that used Scratch, Lego Mindstorm, 3D printing, Python, and even Unity to inspire the curiosity of young students. The camp was largely funded by
a charitable donation from <a href="https://ignitecs.withgoogle.com/"> Google Education's igniteCS program</a>. I later participated on 
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2844658">a panel at SIGCSE 2016 </a> that discussed strategies to encourage undergraduate retention 
in computer science through outreach projects. <!-- ALT LINK <a href="https://www.rhodes.edu/extracurricular/camp-codette"> -->

<p> Currently, I am working at the Learning in Virtual Environments Lab (LiVE) at Vanderbilt University in pursuit of my PhD. Under the guidance 
of <a href="http://www.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/~bobbyb/"> Dr. Bobby Bodenheimer</a>, I primarily pursue two avenues of research. 

<p> The first addresses navigation with and perceived affordances of holograms in augmented reality (AR). 
	The second topic examines how cognitive development affects children's spatial reasoning in VR. 
	However, I also conduct some work in the realm of visualization, especially for visual deficits and the ear. 
	
	<!-- 
	The first involves analyzing how cognitive development affects children's perception and action in VR. 
	The second topic I am pursuing is in the realm of visualization. Using patient data, I can graphically generate 
simulations to enhance training and understanding. I am currently in the process of developing both a visual deficit simulation 
and an interface for cochlear implant training.
	And the second topic I am actively pursing addresses how cognitive development affects children's perceived affordances in VR.

<!-- perception and action in VR. Children have largely been absent from VR literature due to the expensive and cumbersome nature of older VR technology. 
However, it is conceivable that stages of cognitive development may either enhance or hinder perception in immersive media. This would have
dire implications for the design of future social, education, and training applications. My research seeks to isolate these differences 
and ascertain how they will affect children's interactions with VR. The second topic I am pursuing is in the realm of visualization. Using patient data, I can graphically generate 
simulations to enhance training and understanding. I am currently in the process of developing both a visual deficit simulation 
and an interface for cochlear implant training. In the deficit simulation, I have mapped the user's visual field 
to the corresponding field of view of a head-mounted display, and I have generated a graphic representation of perturbations found in patient data
to produce a deficit mapping. The cochlear implant training module is in its nascent stages, but I am excited to develop unique 3D interactions 
and controls. -->

On campus I also enjoy helping out <a href="https://studentorg.vanderbilt.edu/womenincomputing/"> Vanderbilt University's Women in Computing</a>, which is an affiliated ACM-W student chapter. 
In 2017, a team of undergraduates and I hosted an emerging technology symposium with a number of inspiring speakers, including Christina Heller of VR Playhouse.  

<p> When I have the free time, I enjoy making graphite illustrations, surfing, and jogging around the neighborhood. Although, I have not been able to surf much
	since moving to Tennessee :)
