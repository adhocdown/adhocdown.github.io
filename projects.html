			<h3>{ Cochlea Visualization } </h3>
			<p> This project consists of two modules. For the first component, I have generated an 
interactive visualization tool that uses both 2D and 3D data to display accurate, digital representations of the skull and inner ear. The second
component involves the creation of a surgical simulation tool in which a formal training module will be designed to prepair surgeons 
for cochlear implant surgeries. Cochlear implants are sensitive surgeries which can result in permanent hearing loss, in the event 
of even minor mistakes by a surgeon. </p>

			<h3>{ Visual Deficit Simulation } </h3>
			<p>  I am developing a simulation to better understand how visual deficits affect the way 
humans perceive and act with their surroundings. My program converts patient data into a usable form for visualization.
Then, it maps this information onto the binocular visual field of a head-mounted display via a screen shader in Unity. 
The presented figure displays an outlined scotoma for the left eye of a patient with advanced homonymous hemianopia.
The first stage of this project is nearly complete, so keep your eyes peeled for a publication! </p>

			<h3>{ Cognitive Development in VR } </h3>
			<p> In this project, we assess how  preteens (children aged 8-12 years) and teenagers 
(children aged 15-18 years) respond to mismatches between their motor behavior and the visual information presented by an IVE. 
Over two experiments, we evaluate how children physically recalibrate across functionally distinct systems of movement. Namely,
we observed forward walking recalibration and prism throwing adaptation. In adults, both of the protocols have been proven
to induce measured recalibration effects. </p>

			<h3>{  Collaboration in VR } </h3>
			<p> In the presented work, we are interested in how effectively two people will collaborate within 
an environment given that they have never met or even seen each other prior to the experiment. 
We postulate that participants who never meet their partner in a collaborative environment will perform worse 
than those who are able to interact with their partner prior to the performance of a task. 
If this holds true, then it could have important implications for copresence and long distance collaboration. </p>

			<h3>{ Neurocognitve Assessment } </h3>
			<p> Traditional methods of neurocognitve assessment through paper tests and rapid doctor evaluations
have proven to be unreliable determinants of neurocognitve condition. The Virtual Environment Grocery Store
(VEGS) aims to present a complex, malleable environment in which a
participant can safely perform a set of tasks that will examine common
behaviors with correlations to executive functions associated with neurological deficits. In addition, the task 
allows us to analyze underlying neurological processes.</p>
