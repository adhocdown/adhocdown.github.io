			<h3>{ Cognitive Development in VR } </h3>
			<p> In this project, we assess how  preteens (children aged 8-12 years) and teenagers 
(children aged 15-18 years) respond to mismatches between their motor behavior and the visual information presented by an IVE. 
Over two experiments, we evaluate how children physically recalibrate across functionally distinct systems of movement. Namely,
we observed forward walking recalibration and prism throwing adaptation. In adults, both of the protocols have been proven
to induce measured recalibration effects. </p>

			<h3>{ Visual Deficit Simulation } </h3>
			<p>  The first component of this project has been submitted for review. It involves generating a
normalized visualization of macular degeneration and evaluating how the size of scotoma affects street crossing
behavior. Virtual street crossing scenarios provide excellent, controlled mediums in which to evaluate behavioral response. The second component is a proof of concept 
project in which real patient data is used to generate a variety of
visual deficits. The simulation may be used by doctors and the family of the patient to assist diagnosis and improve understanding
of the patient's condition.

			<h3>{  <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2814185">Collaboration in VR</a> } </h3>
			<p> In the presented work, we are interested in how effectively two people will collaborate within 
an environment given that they have never met or even seen each other prior to the experiment. 
We postulate that participants who never meet their partner in a collaborative environment will perform worse 
than those who are able to interact with their partner prior to the performance of a task. 
If this holds true, then it could have important implications for copresence and long distance collaboration. </p>

			<h3>{ Neurocognitve Assessment } </h3>
			<p> Traditional methods of neurocognitve assessment through paper tests and rapid doctor evaluations
have proven to be unreliable determinants of neurocognitve condition. The Virtual Environment Grocery Store
(VEGS) aims to present a complex, malleable environment in which a
participant can safely perform a set of tasks that will examine common
behaviors with correlations to executive functions associated with neurological deficits. In addition, the task 
allows us to analyze underlying neurological processes.</p>
